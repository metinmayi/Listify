# React project: Listify (Still developing)

A shoppinglist application where you can create and share shoppinglists with friends and family!

Technologies used in this project:
* React
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* Express


This project is being created for my own educational purposes.

## Features:
* Create multiple shoppinglists that are accessible with your username and password.
* You can add/remove items to your shoppinglist whenever you want.
* Mark/unmark items as purchased.
* Create/share shoppinglists with friends/family. If they have an account, you can grant them access to edit and read your lists.
* If you accidentally remove a list, don't worry, they're available and able to be restored through the "Old Lists" section.
